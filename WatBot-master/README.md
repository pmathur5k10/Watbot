# MADAI CHAT BOT - An Android ChatBot powered by IBM Watson


Madai Chat Bot is a chat android application that enables the user to interact realtime via speech/text with a bot for insurance related queries.

The banking industry has seen a rise in artificial intelligence. Amongst the popular applications, chatbots have taken the
technology industry by the storm. With the advancements made by IBM Watson in providing services for natural
language processing, interaction with potential as well as existing customers has become more engaging.
The problem that my team is tackling by the means of this challenge is one faced by the insurance agencies for long.
The existing problem can be analysed in two parts. The most dreaded challenge of the banking industry is to get new
customers in their fold by the means of telephonic or inter-personal engagement. This leads to wasted man hours and
unnecessary expenditure in setting up the infrastructure for call centres and training centres. On the other hand , the
potential customers who could have benefited from the schemes are left out leading to rising expenditure and reduced
customer base.
An effective way of solving the problem is by involving AI in the form of chatbots and NLP to understand user
behaviour and providing targeted services. In the project presented along with , the MADAI chat bot offers five basic
services to the user:
• registering for a new policy
• information about existing policy
• filing claim against an existing policy
• claim information about an existing policy
• latest discount/offers on the policy
• cancellation of existing policy
The chatbot is capable of handling sequential requests and also handles critical cases caused by human bias or invalid
information.
It has been assumed that there exists a database consisting of:
• user policy number
• policy id
• account number
• account id
• premium amount
• duration of policy
• Aadhar Card (KYC) information
The JSON file consisting of all intents, entities, dialog has been attached along with the document.
